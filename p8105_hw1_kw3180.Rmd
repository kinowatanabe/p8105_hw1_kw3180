# Problem 1

```{r}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Importing and looking at data set
```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

There are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. The variables in the dataset are: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. The mean is `r mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))`.

## Scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

The temperature fluctuated throughout the day, but there is an upward trend in general. As time passed in January, the temperature increased. The humidity seemed to increase throughout the month.
