## Importing and looking at data set

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

There are 358 rows and 15 columns. The variables in the dataset are:
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp (range: 24.08, 57.92), dewp (range:
8.96, 53.06), humid (range: 32.06, 100), wind_dir (range: 0, 360),
wind_speed (range: 0, 24.16638), wind_gust (range: 16.11092, 31.07106),
precip (range: 0, 0.19), pressure (range: 1010.8, 1034.4), visib (range:
0.12, 10), and time_hour (range: 2013-01-01 01:00:00, 2013-01-15
23:00:00). The mean is 39.5821229.

## Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point() +
    labs(
    title = "Temperature vs. Time",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature",
    color = "Humidity"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw1_kw3180_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

The temperature fluctuated throughout the day, but there is an upward
trend in general through the month. As time passed in January, the
temperature increased. The humidity seemed to increase throughout the
month as well.

# Problem 2

## Create a dataframe

``` r
set.seed(1234)

p2_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_char = letters[1:10],
  vec_logical = rnorm(10) > 0,
  factor_vec = factor(rep(c("level1","level2","level3"), length.out = 10),
        levels = c("level1","level2","level3"))
)
```

## Creating means

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.3831574

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We can find the mean of the random sample of size 10 from a standard
normal distribution (mean = -0.3831574) and a logical vector indicating
whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 (mean = 0.3). We can’t
find the mean for a character vector of length 10 and a factor vector of
length 10, with 3 different factor “levels.”

## Using as.numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, norm_samp))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, factor_vec))
```

We can find the mean of the random sample of size 10 from a standard
normal distribution because this is a numeric variable. As shown with
as.numeric, this just gave us our 10 numbers of our random sample. We
can find the mean of the a logical vector indicating whether elements of
the sample are greater than 0 because R converted “True” and “False” as
binary “1” and “0,” respectively. Converting the logical vector into a
binary number enabled us to find the mean, although nonsensical.

We couldn’t find the mean for a character vector of length 10 because it
is a character variable. When we try to convert it as a numeric variable
with as.numeric, R cannot process it and returns “NA.”

When we try to find the mean for a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels,” we cannot do it because it is a ordinal
categorical variable. When we convert it into numeric with as.numeric,
it codes the levels as integer codes for levels. Even if we took the
mean for these factors, it would be meaningless because the numbers are
arbitrary labels.
